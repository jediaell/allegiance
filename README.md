# Allegiance\_Coding Challenge

In this solution you will find two projects:

The first (Angular Projects) is a basic project with the solution for the requirement, I use a basic architecture to solve the development, of course we can implement different types of architecture such as redux but the architecture that is implemented is a good way to comply with this requirement.

Steps to execute the project:

First (Angular Project) we open the folder "/ assets /" open the folder "/ settings /" and we open the file "/app.settings.json", we change the value in "apiUrl".

Second, just run npm install and then ng serve -o

The second project is a basic API that uses .Net Core, open it and run it. you just have a ContactController with a basic Get without insurance, it's like a mockup.

If you have any questions, call me.
